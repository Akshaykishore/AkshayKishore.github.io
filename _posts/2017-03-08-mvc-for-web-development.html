The state is what your application is&nbsp;<i>about</i>. If your application is a forum, your Model might contain Class::DBI objects representing threads, users and postings. The Model does not know anything about HTML, or web servers or anything like that. It just supplies ways to query the state, and ways to change that state.</span></div></div><div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-sec-5"><h2 id="sec-5" style="font-size: 1.3em; font-weight: normal; margin: 4em 0px 1em;"><span style="background-color: white; color: cyan; font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">View</span></h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5" style="color: #221111;"><span style="background-color: white; font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">The View is the representation of the user interface. Usually there are many (possibly nested) Views in a single application. A view can query the model, but it is not supposed to change the state. In web based MVC systems, a view can be implemented using a template that renders an HTML page. In our hypothetical forum application, the Views would be the templates for rendering a full thread, the login page, the posting page etc.</span></div></div><div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-sec-6"><h2 id="sec-6" style="font-size: 1.3em; font-weight: normal; margin: 4em 0px 1em;"><span style="background-color: white; color: cyan; font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">Controller</span></h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6" style="color: #221111;"><span style="background-color: white; font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">User actions on the View are send to the Controller. In a web environment, this is usually done by having the Controller handle the incoming HTTP requests.</span><br /><span style="background-color: white; font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">The Controller receives user requests, and translates them into actions that the Model should take. Then it selects the appropriate View to handle the response.</span><br /><span style="background-color: white; font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">It is possible to have more than one Controller, but most web application frameworks I’ve used assume you only have one.</span></div></div><div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-sec-7"><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7"><h4 style="text-align: left;"><span style="background-color: white; color: cyan; font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">Front end mvc:</span></h4><div style="color: #221111;"><span style="background-color: white; font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">In order to start with web development first just pick what &nbsp;are &nbsp;the things u want to study first ,if u want to start with frontend developement just go with</span></div><div style="color: #221111;"></div><ul style="color: #221111; text-align: left;"><li><span style="background-color: white; font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">html</span></li><li><span style="background-color: white; font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">css</span></li><li><span style="background-color: white; font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">js</span></li><li><span style="background-color: white; font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">reactjs</span></li><li><span style="background-color: white; font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">redux\flux</span></li></ul><div style="color: #221111;"></div><div style="color: #221111;"><span style="background-color: white; font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">which were the trending frontend MVC .</span></div><div style="color: #555555; font-size: 16px; line-height: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top: 1em;"><span style="background-color: white; font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">The frontend of an application is distinctly human. It’s what the user sees, touches and experiences. In this respect, empathy is a required characteristic of a good frontend developer. The frontend of an application is less about code and more about how a user will interpret the interface into an experience. That experience can be the difference between a billion-dollar company and complete collapse. If you were a MySpace user in 2004, you were probably content with the experience. But once you started to use Facebook, you almost certainly had a better experience. You realized that you could socialize with a simpler design, no flashing banner ads, easy-to-find friends, etc. Facebook and MySpace had a lot of differences under the hood as well (backend), but at least part of Facebook’s triumph can be attributed to a better frontend and user experience.</span></div><div dir="ltr" style="color: #555555; font-size: 16px; line-height: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top: 1em;"><span style="background-color: white; font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;"><span id="more-1376" style="background-color: white;"></span></span></div><div dir="ltr" style="color: #555555; font-size: 16px; line-height: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top: 1em;"><strong><span style="background-color: white; font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">The technical skills required to be a frontend developer commonly include:</span></strong></div><ul style="color: #333333; font-size: 16px; margin: 1em 0px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 40px; text-align: left;"><li><div style="color: #555555; line-height: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top: 1em;"><span style="background-color: white; font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">HTML – All code in a web application is eventually translated to HTML. It’s the language that web browsers understand and use to display information to users. A web developer’s understanding of HTML is analogous to a carpenter’s understanding of a screwdriver. It’s so important and necessary that it’s often assumed for employment.</span></div></li><li><div style="color: #555555; line-height: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top: 1em;"><span style="background-color: white; font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">CSS – By itself, HTML is quite plain. HTML does provide some basic style options, but to build a good frontend, developers must have experience with CSS. CSS provides the paint, templates, glitter, buttons, tassel, lights, and many other things that can be used to improve the presentation of a web page. CSS is so commonly used that languages have been built to make writing CSS easier. These languages – like Sass and LESS – are also known as CSS precompilers, but they are simply used to write more efficient and manageable CSS code.</span></div></li><li><div style="color: #555555; line-height: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top: 1em; text-align: left;"><span style="background-color: white; font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">JavaScript – If you could only learn one language in your lifetime, you’d be well-advised to choose JavaScript. Though it’s not exclusively a frontend language, that’s where it’s most commonly used. JavaScript is a language that is run on a client machine, i.e. a user’s computer. This means that JavaScript can be used to program fast, intuitive and fun user experiences, without forcing a user to refresh their web page. Drag-and-drop, infinite-scroll and videos that come to life on a web page can all be programmed with JavaScript. JavaScript is so popular that entire frameworks have been built just to make building application frontends easier. Frameworks like Angular, Ember, React and Backbone are all very widely used for JavaScript-heavy frontends.</span></div></li></ul><h4 style="text-align: left;"><span style="background-color: white; color: cyan; font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">BACK END MVC:</span></h4><div><div dir="ltr" style="color: #555555; font-size: 16px; line-height: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top: 1em;"><span style="background-color: white; font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">The backend of a web application is an enabler for a frontend experience. An application’s frontend may be the most beautifully crafted web page, but if the application itself doesn’t work, the application will be a failure. The backend of an application is responsible for things like calculations, business logic, database interactions, and performance. Most of the code that is required to make an application work will be done on the backend. Backend code is run on the server, as opposed to the client. This means that backend developers not only need to understand programming languages and databases, but they must have an understanding of server architecture as well. If an application is slow, crashes often, or constantly throws errors at users, it’s likely because of backend problems.</span></div><div style="color: #555555; font-size: 16px; line-height: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top: 1em;"><span style="background-color: white; font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">Backend development is not all ones and zeros though. Much like frontend development, backend development has a human aspect to it as well. Since most of the code for an application is written on the backend, it should be easy to understand and work with. Most backend languages – like Ruby and Python – have standardized styles and idioms that make reading and writing code more efficient and enjoyable.</span></div><div dir="ltr" style="color: #555555; font-size: 16px; line-height: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top: 1em;"><strong><span style="background-color: white; font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">The technical skills required to be a backend web developer commonly include:</span></strong></div><ul style="color: #333333; font-size: 16px; margin: 1em 0px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 40px;"><li dir="ltr"><div dir="ltr" style="color: #555555; line-height: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top: 1em;"><span style="background-color: white; font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">Ruby – Ruby is a programming language created to be fun and efficient. Ruby syntax is easy to read, even for people who don’t know Ruby. Ruby was thrust into the mainstream thanks to Ruby on Rails, which is a framework (built with Ruby) for building web applications. Ruby on Rails is one of the most popular web development tools for small businesses and startups. Companies like Twitter, Hulu and Github all started and / or still use Ruby on Rails in some capacity. Ruby can be used to code business logic, calculate data and distribute servers for better performance.</span></div></li><li dir="ltr"><div dir="ltr" style="color: #555555; line-height: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top: 1em;"><span style="background-color: white; font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">Python – Much like Ruby, Python is known in part for its readability. A popular web development framework, Django, also makes Python a popular choice for building web applications. Dropbox was built with – and still uses – Python to run much of its server-side code. Python can be used for everything Ruby can. Whether you use&nbsp;Python or Ruby depends on your skill set, the communities you’re exposed to, and your development team.</span></div></li><li dir="ltr"><div dir="ltr" style="color: #555555; line-height: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top: 1em;"><span style="background-color: white; font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">SQL – SQL is a universal database query language. SQL is used to interact with databases, which are a part of every backend web application. No matter what language or framework you choose to build your web application, you will likely use SQL, or some abstraction of it, to interact with the database.</span></div></li></ul><span style="background-color: white; color: #555555; font-family: &quot;times&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These were all about mvc in both frontend and backend.....</span></div></div></div></div></div>
