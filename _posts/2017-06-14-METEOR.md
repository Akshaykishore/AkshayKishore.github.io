Hello Everyone!
This is my short overview about metero.

**METEOR INTERGRATION**
Intially let's discuss about some of the things that metero intergrates with :

* NPM
* REACT JS
* ANGULAR 
* MONGODB
* CORDOVA

One of the main advantage of using metero is that as you all guess it's intergrated with **MERN** 
along with **MEAN** that is for both angular and react.

**What is cordova ?**

Cordova ,formerly called as Phone Gap is a platform to build Native Mobile Applicatons using HTML5, CSS and Java Script.
In other words it acts  a container for running a web application written in HTML, CSS,JS Typically Web applications 
cannot use the native device functionality like Camera, GPS, Accelerometer , Contacts etc. .
With Cordova we can very much achieve this and package the web application in the devices installer format.
