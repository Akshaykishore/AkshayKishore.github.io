<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><h2 style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: purple;">ES-2018</span></h2><div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hello guys, this topic is something that deals about the newly arrived version of ECMA SCRIPT . I haven't used this words ever since before ,dealing about other topics but it actually plays a simple role in MERN stack development especially in R as you all guess yes it's react . Dont think that why i am going back again i should tell this attaractive feature of es-2018 i cannot restrict myself without telling this so let me explain about es2016 first and then move to es-2018 .ECMA SCRIPT plays a vital role in react that converts es2016 to es2015 because the code we write in react is using es2016 that is actually not understandable by the browser in order to understand the code we will convert &nbsp;it into es2016.If you want know more about how this conversion occurs go the following link and get in detail about it. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Akshaykishore/conversion-of-script-es6-es5-using-babel-">https://github.com/Akshaykishore/conversion-of-script-es6-es5-using-babel-</a></div><div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I haven't talked much about es2016 because it's actually not going to be used in further &nbsp;because of the arrival of ES-2018. The newly arrived ES-2018 have the following additional features ,</div><div style="text-align: left;"></div><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Global declaration</li><li>Shortcut for using symbols</li><li>Dot operator for all</li></ul>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Inorder to know how it actually works just see the video given below<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><object width="320" height="266" class="BLOG_video_class" id="BLOG_video-b35ac2f7ae2fae2c" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="movie" value="//www.youtube.com/get_player"><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true"><param name="flashvars" value="flvurl=https://redirector.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?requiressl%3Dyes%26id%3Db35ac2f7ae2fae2c%26itag%3D5%26source%3Dblogger%26app%3Dblogger%26cmo%3Dsecure_transport%253Dyes%26cmo%3Dsensitive_content%253Dyes%26ip%3D0.0.0.0%26ipbits%3D0%26expire%3D1499298927%26sparams%3Drequiressl,id,itag,source,ip,ipbits,expire%26signature%3D14A835DDBD462B924D0085517EFD8774397004C7.5857C4419060626DFB9C0EEA2523E9F3DFE209CF%26key%3Dck2&amp;iurl=http://video.google.com/ThumbnailServer2?app%3Dblogger%26contentid%3Db35ac2f7ae2fae2c%26offsetms%3D5000%26itag%3Dw160%26sigh%3DbbXTEF3bIBXoYin0b71VNbADpHs&amp;autoplay=0&amp;ps=blogger"><embed src="//www.youtube.com/get_player" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="320" height="266" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" flashvars="flvurl=https://redirector.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?requiressl%3Dyes%26id%3Db35ac2f7ae2fae2c%26itag%3D5%26source%3Dblogger%26app%3Dblogger%26cmo%3Dsecure_transport%253Dyes%26cmo%3Dsensitive_content%253Dyes%26ip%3D0.0.0.0%26ipbits%3D0%26expire%3D1499298927%26sparams%3Drequiressl,id,itag,source,ip,ipbits,expire%26signature%3D14A835DDBD462B924D0085517EFD8774397004C7.5857C4419060626DFB9C0EEA2523E9F3DFE209CF%26key%3Dck2&iurl=http://video.google.com/ThumbnailServer2?app%3Dblogger%26contentid%3Db35ac2f7ae2fae2c%26offsetms%3D5000%26itag%3Dw160%26sigh%3DbbXTEF3bIBXoYin0b71VNbADpHs&autoplay=0&ps=blogger" allowFullScreen="true" /></object></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I think you all would be wondered by seeing the functionalities of es-2018 that too especially that dot operator which would make us syntax free really i have wondered by these features .That's it for todays section catch you all later.
