Hello Everyone!
This is my short overview about Jenkins.
Is the pic above is confusing you guys ,donna worry let's demistify it .
The pic above is a mix of jenkins,github and docker yes jenkins is  a 
combination of all three.Now we could move on to the topic.

<span style="color:green">**JENKINS**</span>
<p align="justify"> 
Jenkins is a open source automation server that is used to automate all
sorts of tasks such as building,testing and deployment services.
</p>

<span style="color:green">**why jenkins**</span>
<p align="justify"> 
It is mainly used for github,why in the sense a team project in github
may include several uploads from several users and it is diffcult to find 
if there occurs a bug.Searching time of these bugs to be identified may also
take more time . Now you guys would have guessed what would be the jenkins role.
Yes ,ofcourse it is used for the process of testing each of the components of 
of different users upload .Test case would be tested by itself and then only code 
would be updated .</p>

<span style="color:green">**why Docker in jenkins**</span>
<p align="justify"> 
Jenkins can be installed through native system packages, Docker,
or even run standalone by any machine with the Java Runtime Environment installed.
This is why docker comes in jenkins .</p>
This is all about jenkins in detail.
