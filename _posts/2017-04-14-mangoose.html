<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: purple;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MANGOOSE ODM</span></h2><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As you all know myself akshay ,it has been almost a week we were not in touch ,its okay things &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; apart lets enter into the todays topic .As i have already told about this topic name in my last blog &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; itself yes ,ofcourse the same topic we are gonna discuss now .</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><h3 style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; <span style="color: cyan;">&nbsp; MANGOOSE</span></h3><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mongoose provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks and more, out &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of the box.</div><div><br /></div><div><span style="color: blue;">JSON and BSON</span></div><div><span style="color: blue;"><br /></span></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;MongoDB is a NoSQL database system which stores data in the form of JSON or BSON &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; documents.Lets see about what is json and bson first,</div><div><br /></div><div><span style="color: blue;">JSON</span></div><div><span style="color: blue;"><br /></span></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is an open, human and machine-readable standard that &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; facilitates data interchange, and along with XML is the main format for data interchange used</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on the modern web. JSON supports all the basic datatypes youâ€™d expect :numbers, strings, and &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; boolean values, as well as arrays and hashes.Document databases such as &nbsp;MongoDB use JSON &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; documents in order to store records, just as tables and rows store records in a relational database.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><span style="color: blue;">Binary JSON (BSON)</span></div><div><span style="color: blue;"><br /></span></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;MongoDB represents JSON documents in binary-encoded format called BSON behind the &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;scenes. BSON extends the JSON modelto provide additional data types, ordered fields, and</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to be efficient for encoding and decoding within different languages.</div><div><br /></div><div><span style="color: blue;">MongoDB, BSON, and JSON</span></div><div><span style="color: blue;"><br /></span></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The MongoDB BSON implementation is lightweight, fast and highly traversable. Like JSON, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MongoDB's BSON implementation &nbsp;supports embedding objects and arrays within other &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; objects and arrays â€“ MongoDB can even 'reach inside' BSON objects to build indexes and &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; match objects against query expressions on both top-level and nested BSON keys. This means &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that MongoDB gives users the ease of use and flexibility of JSON documents together with &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the speed and richness of a lightweight binary format.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: cyan;">WHY MANGOOSE?</span></h3><div>&nbsp;Mongoose is built upon the MongoDB driver to provide programmers with a way to model their data.</div><div><br /></div><div>&nbsp;1)However I will list some advantages and disadvantages of using both approaches.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Using Mongoose, a user can define the schema for the documents in a particular collection.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; It provides a lot of convenience in the creation and management of data in MongoDB. On the &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;downside,learning mongoose can take some time, and has some limitations in handling schemas</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;that are quite complex.</div><div><br /></div><div>&nbsp;2)However, if your collection schema is unpredictable, or you want a Mongo-shell like experience &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;inside Node.js, &nbsp;then go ahead and use the MongoDB driver. It is the simplest to pick up. The &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;downside here is that you will have to write larger amounts of code for validating the data, and &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the risk of errors is higher.</div><div><br /></div><div>&nbsp; That's it guys i dont want to go much into this topic in detail you all yourself could now much in &nbsp; detail when you all work with it . If you guys want to know about this you could refer the following link&nbsp;<a href="http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html">mangoose</a>&nbsp;.
