<span style="color:Magenta">**POPULAR HYBRID APP DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORKS**</span>

Hi Everyone!
This is one of the continuation of the last  topic in that we had discussed only about **meteor** ,
here we were going to discuss about all other in detail.Let's directly get into the topic.

<span style="color:blue">**React Native**</span> :
The main purpose of this framework is to build native apps, instead of developing hybrid apps which 
run in a web-view. However, the development is still completely done via React and JavaScript. This 
framework is not customized towards beginners in website development, but its huge community will help
you in every part of the way. The latest version of this framework also have support for Android, so
now you can also have real cross-platform apps.

<span style="color:blue">**Onsen UI**</span> :
With the help of this open source framework, developers can build apps by combining native-looking components.
This easy-to-use framework is able to work without AngularJS. It also has good documentation which includes
lots of layouts and examples for common app structures. One main disadvantage of this framework is that it 
offers only iOS theme, although its next version promises to offer Material Design support.

<span style="color:blue">**Ionic**</span> :
This is a popular framework and preferred the choice of many developers. The CSS portion of this framework can
be used to create native looking designs. If you want to harness the complete potential of Ionic, you should 
pair it with AngularJS. With Ionic, youâ€™ll also get the command-line interface which comprises tremendous features
including a Cordova-based app package and integrated emulators.

<span style="color:blue">**Framework 7**</span> :
One of the best features of this framework is that it does not have any external dependencies like React or Angular.
Still, it manages to make apps feel and look native, with eye-catchy animations and properly styled components. Any
developer who has knowledge of CSS, HTML, and JavaScript can easily create an app without making convoluted code. 
This framework does not include any tool for app packaging or emulation; therefore, you have to combine it with PhoneGap or Cordova.

There were still many types of frameworks like this,as i usually say you guys dont need to master every thing but one among them 
is a good number.
